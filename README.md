## What is Freshmaker?

Freshmaker is a service which:

* Rebuilds various artifacts after its dependencies changed. For example:
  * Rebuilds module when .spec file of RPM in a module is updated or  the RPM is pushed to stable using Bodhi.
  * Rebuilds container image when RPM in a container is updated or pushed to stable using Bodhi.
  * ...
* Provides a REST API to retrieve information about artifact rebuilds and the reasons for these rebuilds and sends messages to the message bus about these event.
* Is based on Event-Handler architecture:
  * Events are fedmsg messages received from other services like dist-git, Koji, Bodhi, ...
  * Handlers are small classes using the high-level API provided to them by Freshmaker core to rebuild artifacts.
* Provides high-level API to track dependencies between artifacts and make rebuilding of them easy.

## How does it work?

Freshmaker waits for new fedmsg messages about artifact being updated,
this happens in `consumer.py`. Every fedmsg message handled by a Freshmaker
is parsed by one of the parsers which can be found in the `parsers` directory.
This parser converts the fedmsg to `Event` object (inherits from `BaseEvent`).
All the events are defined in the `events.py`.

This Event object is then handled by one or more handlers defined
in the `handlers` directory.

The handlers typically do following:

* Find out the list of artifacts like RPMs, Container images, ... which must be rebuilt as result of Event.
  * There are built-in classes to find these information in PDC or Lightblue.
* Plan the rebuild of artifacts and store them in Freshmaker database in tree-like structure.
  * Artifacts can depend on each other and Freshmaker ensures they are built in the right order.
* Prepare the prerequisites for a rebuild.
  * This can for example mean generating RPM repository with updated packages using ODCS.
* Start the rebuild.

Most of the common tasks for handlers are already implemented in Freshmaker including:

* Database and methods to store artifacts, their dependencies and all the information to build them there.
* Classes to get the information about artifacts from Koji, Lightblue, PDC, MBS, ...
* Classes to start the builds in Koji, ODCS, MBS, ...

The handler which rebuilds all the modules after the `.spec` file of RPM including in a module is updated can look like this:

```python
class RebuildImagesOnGitRPMSpecChange(BaseHandler):
    name = "RebuildImagesOnGitRPMSpecChange"

    def can_handle(self, event):
        return isinstance(event, GitRPMSpecChangeEvent)

    def handle(self, event):
        # Get the list of modules with this package from this branch using PDC.
        pdc = PDC(conf)
        modules = pdc.get_latest_modules(component_name=event.rpm,
                                         component_branch=event.branch,
                                         active='true')

        for module in modules:
            name = module['variant_name']
            version = module['variant_version']

            # Check if Freshmaker is configured to rebuild this module.
            if not self.allow_build(ArtifactType.MODULE, name=name, version=version):
                continue

            # To rebuild a module, we need to bump its release in dist-git repo.
            commit_msg = "Bump to rebuild because of %s rpm spec update (%s)." % (event.rpm, event.rev)
            rev = utils.bump_distgit_repo('modules', name, branch=version, commit_msg=commit_msg, logger=log)

            # We start the rebuild of a module and store it in Freshmkaer DB.
            build_id = self.build_module(name, version, rev)
            if build_id is not None:
                self.record_build(event, name, ArtifactType.MODULE, build_id)
```
