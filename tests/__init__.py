# There is no Flask app-context in the tests and we need some,
# because models.Event.json() and models.ArtifactBuild.json() uses
# flask.url_for, which needs app_context to generate the URL.
# We also cannot generate Flask context on the fly each time in the
# mentioned json() calls, because each generation of Flask context
# changes db.session and unfortunatelly does not give it to original
# state which might be Flask bug, so the only safe way on backend is
app_context = app.app_context()
# We do not care about __exit__ in a tests, because the app_context is
# just use during the whole test-suite run.
